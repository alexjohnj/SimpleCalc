# SimpleCalc 2.7 #

- Added auto update functionality. 

# SimpleCalc 2.6.3 #

- Several bugs squashed!
- NSNumberFormatter updated to use the default formatter of OS 10.4+ instead of the previous formatter for OS 10.0+. This means more accurate rounding and also means negative numbers now appears as -x instead of in brackets.
- An annoying bug which occurred when X-X = 0 has been fixed. (Before the fix, the answer would equal 0.0.00).
- Moved some buttons around.
- Code refinements (thanks to changing the NSNumberFormatter version to OS 10.4+).
- The keyboard shortcut for calculating averages has been changed from CMD+A to CMD+Shift+A to avoid conflict with the select all shortcut.
- Many variables have been replaced with arrays to make future changes easier.
