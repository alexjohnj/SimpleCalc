SimpleCalc
=========

Thanks for downloading SimpleCalc. SimpleCalc is a really simple, form based calculator. The idea is for it to be really easy to use. That's probably the best description I can give of it. The application is written in _Objective C_ and makes use of the _Sparkle_ framework. 

Crap that needs doing
--------------------------

There's a few things that need to be done to SimpleCalc. I'm trying to wind this project down now so these things are relatively basic but they would help put the "icing on the cake" for a final release of SimpleCalc, before development (by me at least) is stopped. 

- Full translation into Italian (currently, the preferences window needs translating).
- A native Spanish speaker to check the Spanish translation (Spanish is not my first language so there's likely a lot of errors in the translation).
- Localisation into as many languages as possible. This would be pretty awesome. 

---

So there isn't actually a lot to do. Localisation is really it. If I think of anything else that needs adding, I'll add it to this to do list but I'm doubtful any major new features are going to emerge in SimpleCalc anymore. 

KTHXBAI!
